## Daily Summary - 09.07

### Session Overview
Working on AGRO AI Itinerary Builder - troubleshooting why the app stopped working after previous changes.

### Issues Identified
1. **Primary Issue**: App not loading at localhost:5173 - blank page/connection refused
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: 
   - Firewall was already disabled (not the issue)
   - TypeScript compilation errors were blocking the build
   - Possible localhost resolution or browser-specific issues

### Actions Taken

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Added comprehensive logging to track app initialization:
   - `[MAIN]` logs in main.tsx for React mounting
   - `[APP]` logs in App.tsx for component lifecycle
   - `[ITINERARY]` logs for data fetching
2. Fixed TypeScript errors in error handling (error type annotations)
3. Verified file structure and data files exist in public/data/
4. Tested multiple server configurations (ports 5173, 3000, 4173, 8000)
5. Verified localhost resolution and /etc/hosts configuration

#### Infrastructure Setup
1. Created GitHub Actions workflow for daily summaries
2. Set up summary generation script (scripts/create-summary.sh)
3. Created to-do-summaries directory structure
4. Fixed directory naming inconsistency (ToDo-summaries → to-do-summaries)

### Current Status
- ✅ App builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Initial commit completed with all project files
- ❌ Server accessibility issue remains unresolved
- ❓ Possible browser extension or local network configuration issue

### Next Steps
1. Test in different browsers (Safari, Firefox)
2. Check for browser extensions blocking local connections
3. Try accessing from another device on the network
4. Consider using a different development setup (e.g., ngrok for tunneling)
5. Investigate if recent macOS or browser updates changed localhost handling

### Technical Details
- Node version: v22.16.0
- npm version: 10.9.2
- Vite version: 7.0.3
- React version: 19.1.0
- React Router version: 7.6.3

### Lessons Learned
- Always add diagnostic logging before assuming the root cause
- Check TypeScript compilation errors early in troubleshooting
- Modern browser security can interfere with localhost development
- Having a simple test file (like test.html) helps isolate server vs app issues
