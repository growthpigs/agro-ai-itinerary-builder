# AGRO AI Image Links Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The audit reveals that **ALL image links in the producers.json file are broken**. The issue is that the JSON file references images with the path prefix `/src/assets/images/producers/webp/full/` but the actual files are located at `src/assets/images/producers/webp/full/` (without the leading slash).

## Key Findings

1. **Path Prefix Issue**: All image paths in the JSON start with `/src/` which creates an absolute path from the root, but the files are actually in a relative path `src/`
2. **All Files Exist**: Good news - all referenced image files actually exist in the filesystem
3. **Consistent Naming**: The filenames in the JSON match the actual files exactly

**Total: 104 broken image links across 26 producers**

## Solution

The fix is simple and consistent across all images. You need to remove the leading slash from all image paths in the producers.json file.

### Before (Broken):
```json
"image": "/src/assets/images/producers/webp/full/filename.webp"
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
"image": "src/assets/images/producers/webp/full/filename.webp"
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `/Users/rodericandrews/agro-ai-itinerary-builder/public/data/producers.json`
2. Find and replace all instances of `"/src/assets/` with `"src/assets/`
3. This will fix all 104 broken image links at once

## Additional Notes

- There's one extra file in the directory: `avonmore-berry-farm.webp` which appears to be unused
- All producers have exactly 4 images each (1 main image + 3 additional in the images array)
- The file naming is consistent and matches between JSON and filesystem
- No missing files were found - the issue is purely a path reference problem
