# AGRO AI Itinerary Builder - Development Log

## Issue: Buttons Not Clicking on Make Itinerary Page
**Date**: August 23, 2025
**Reporter**: User
**Status**: Investigating

### Problem Description
After adding an admin panel, the buttons on the default page (Make Itinerary page) stopped working. None of the buttons respond to clicks.

### Investigation Steps

#### 1. Initial Analysis (12:30 PM)
- Checked git history - no commits mentioning "admin" found
- Reviewed recent changes in App.tsx and Layout.tsx
- Found SafeLink component is being used instead of regular links

#### 2. Component Review (12:35 PM)
- **ItineraryBuilder.tsx**: 
  - Uses Button components from `@/components/ui/button`
  - Has onClick handlers properly defined
  - Buttons for: "Start My Itinerary", "Browse by Producer", "Browse by Category"
  
- **Layout.tsx**: 
  - Version: v2.2.0-thin-nav
  - Uses SafeLink for navigation instead of regular Link components
  - Has mobile menu with Sheet component

- **SafeLink.tsx**:
  - Custom component that validates and handles different link types
  - Has event.stopPropagation() to prevent card clicks
  - Extensive logging for debugging

- **Button.tsx**:
  - Standard shadcn/ui button component
  - Uses Slot from radix-ui when asChild prop is true

#### 3. Server Status (12:36 PM)
- Development server running successfully on http://localhost:8080
- No build errors reported

### Hypothesis
1. **Event Propagation Issue**: SafeLink's stopPropagation might be interfering with button clicks
2. **Z-index/Overlay Issue**: Something might be overlaying the buttons, preventing clicks
3. **JavaScript Error**: Runtime error preventing event handlers from attaching
4. **CSS Issue**: Pointer-events might be disabled on buttons

### Next Steps
1. Add console.log to button onClick handlers to verify if they're being called
2. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
3. Inspect element to check z-index and pointer-events CSS
4. Test if issue exists on all buttons or just specific ones

### Debug Code Added
- Enhanced logging in ItineraryBuilder component for button clicks
- Will monitor console output when testing

### Testing Environment
- **Local URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Node Version**: (To be checked)
- **Browser**: (To be tested in multiple browsers)
